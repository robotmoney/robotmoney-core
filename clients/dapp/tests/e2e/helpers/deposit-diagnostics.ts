/**
 * Deposit-failure diagnostics for the dapp e2e suite (issue #1380).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * `registry-receipt-rows.spec.ts` intermittently fails on `dev` itself with an
 * opaque `vault.deposit(...) REVERTED`. Gas accounting across three failing CI
 * runs proved the revert happens PAST every one of `RobotMoneyVault._deposit`'s
 * six guards — the reverted deposits burned 1.44M-1.55M gas against 1.205M for
 * a complete success, and all six guards run before `super._deposit`. So the
 * revert is deep inside `_routeDeposit`, where the vault hands USDC to the
 * Aave V3 / Compound V3 / Morpho adapters, which on this devnet call REAL Base
 * mainnet protocol code and storage ingested into the genesis alloc
 * (`testing/ethereum-testnet/config/fork-block.json`).
 *
 * Two candidates survive that evidence and a receipt cannot separate them:
 * an adapter- or protocol-internal custom error, or an out-of-gas. This module
 * is the instrument that separates them, so the NEXT occurrence names its own
 * cause in the job log instead of requiring a gas-forensics dive across
 * artifacts. It is diagnostic only — it fixes nothing and asserts nothing.
 *
 * ## Why a receipt is not enough, and how the revert data is recovered
 *
 * An Ethereum receipt carries `status: 0` and nothing else — the revert
 * payload is not stored on chain. To see it you must re-execute the call.
 * `diagnoseRevertedDeposit` therefore replays the transaction with `eth_call`,
 * rebuilt from `eth_getTransactionByHash` so the `from`, `value`, calldata AND
 * **gas limit** all match the original — passing the original gas limit is what
 * lets an out-of-gas reproduce at all, since `eth_call` otherwise runs with a
 * near-unlimited budget and would silently "succeed".
 *
 * ## Which block the replay is pinned to, and why it is never `latest`
 *
 * Primary pin: the receipt's OWN `blockNumber` — the block that contains the
 * failed transaction.
 *
 *   - State: geth evaluates `eth_call` against the state at the END of the
 *     named block. The deposit reverted, so it committed no state changes;
 *     end-of-block-N state is therefore the same state the transaction
 *     actually executed against.
 *   - Context: block N's header supplies the same `block.timestamp` and
 *     `block.number` the real execution saw. That matters here specifically —
 *     the leading hypothesis is time-accrued adapter balances crossing a
 *     `capBps` threshold, and Aave/Compound/Morpho interest accrual is a pure
 *     function of the block timestamp. Replaying at a different timestamp can
 *     fail to reproduce the very revert we are chasing.
 *
 * A cross-check replay at the PARENT block (N-1) is reported alongside it,
 * because end-of-block-N state only equals pre-transaction state when the
 * failing deposit was alone in its block (it was, in every observed failure —
 * that is what made the gas accounting possible). If the two replays ever
 * disagree, that disagreement is itself the finding.
 *
 * `latest` is deliberately NOT used anywhere in this module, for the deposit
 * replay or for the routing-state reads. A `latest`-pinned read against this
 * devnet is the documented defect class of issue #1367 and
 * `docs/testing/geth-state-lag.md`: it resolves against whatever state the
 * node has settled on now, not the state at the failure, which is exactly the
 * state under investigation.
 *
 * ## What the report says, and two things learned while proving it works
 *
 * The report ends in a single VERDICT line, so the job log answers the
 * question without a reader having to weigh the pieces. Two corrections came
 * out of exercising it against a real geth node with forced reverts:
 *
 *   1. "Empty revert data means out of gas" is true only for a TOP-LEVEL
 *      out-of-gas. A sub-call that runs out of gas leaves the caller its
 *      EIP-150 1/64 reserve, and OpenZeppelin's `Address` wrapper then reverts
 *      with a well-formed `FailedInnerCall()` selector. Reading the payload
 *      alone would report gas starvation as a custom error, so the VERDICT
 *      takes the call trace's `out of gas` frame as authoritative over it.
 *   2. `RobotMoneyVault`'s own `PerDepositCapExceeded` / `TVLCapExceeded` /
 *      `DepositsPaused` / `VaultShutdown` / `VaultRetired` / `NoActiveAdapters`
 *      guards are NOT reachable through ERC-4626 `deposit()` or `mint()`:
 *      `maxDeposit` (:565) already returns 0 or clamps to `perDepositCap` for
 *      every one of those conditions, so OpenZeppelin's max check fires first
 *      and the caller sees `ERC4626ExceededMaxDeposit(receiver, assets, max)`.
 *      They remain defence in depth for internal callers. For this
 *      investigation that is a useful exclusion: the flake's revert cannot be
 *      any of the six guards, which is independent confirmation of the gas
 *      accounting that put it past them.
 *
 * ## Safety
 *
 * Every entry point is total: each section is individually try/caught and
 * degrades to a "diagnostics unavailable" line. Nothing here throws, and the
 * spec calls it only after it has already observed `status !== "success"` — so
 * a happy-path deposit performs none of these reads and cannot be reddened by
 * them (issue #1380 AC4; the harm pattern of issues #1366 / #1374).
