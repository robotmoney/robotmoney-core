/**
 * Live registry-decode coverage — BalancesPanel receipt rows (issue #1348).
 *
 * This is the only assertion in the suite that depends on the dapp
 * successfully decoding `VaultRegistry.getVault` against a real chain.
 *
 * Why it is needed: `getVault` returns TWO top-level outputs
 * (`VaultMetadata`, `status`). `abi.ts` previously declared a single 9-field
 * tuple, so every decode failed. `VaultRegistryContext` swallows per-call
 * failures (`if (result.status !== "success") continue`), so a broken decode
 * degrades SILENTLY to an empty vault list — nothing throws, nothing logs.
 * `BalancesPanel` (mounted app-wide, `main.tsx:160`) is the only mounted
 * consumer of the resulting `VaultRecord[]`, and it renders one receipt row
 * per registered vault the wallet holds shares in. So:
 *
 *   decode broken -> vaults = [] -> no receipt rows -> this spec is RED.
 *
 * Every other dapp-e2e assertion about vaults reads the explorer API
 * (`GET /v1/vaults`, `GET /v1/accounts/:address/positions`) rather than the
 * registry, so none of them can catch a registry decode regression.
 * Deliberately assert the receipt ROW, not merely that the panel renders —
 * the panel renders fine with an empty vault list, which is exactly the
 * false-green this spec exists to prevent.
 *
 * The wallet must actually hold shares for the row to be legitimate, and the
 * demo seeder funds derived depositor EOAs rather than the admin EOA, so this
 * spec makes its own signed deposit first rather than depending on state left
 * behind by another spec.
 *
 * That setup deposit must be verified in two ways before the UI assertion can
 * mean anything (issue #1366) — get either wrong and a setup failure is
 * misreported as the registry regression this spec exists to catch:
 *
 *   1. Both transaction receipts are checked for `status === "success"`. viem
 *      resolves `waitForTransactionReceipt` for REVERTED transactions too.
 *   2. The share-balance read is POLLED, never sampled once. A confirmed
 *      receipt does not imply readable state on this devnet — see
 *      `docs/testing/geth-state-lag.md`.
