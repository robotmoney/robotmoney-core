// Canonical: docs/architecture.md §3 — Technology Stack

/**
 * wagmi/viem client setup. The dapp uses the browser-injected EIP-1193
 * provider (MetaMask, hardware bridges, etc.) as its primary wallet
 * connector AND as its primary read transport for the foundry/devnet chain —
 * see `docs/technical/dapp-topology.md` §2 ("No dapp-owned RPC"). All
 * traffic for the chain the user is interacting with traverses an
 * endpoint the user chose, not one this bundle was built with.
 *
 * Exception — price-strip reads on the devnet chain: when `VITE_DEVNET_RPC_URL`
 * is set at build time, an HTTP transport at that URL is added as a fallback
 * (after `unstable_connector(injected)`) for the devnet chain only. This
 * allows `useReadContract` calls (e.g. Uniswap V3 slot0 reads for the price
 * strip) to succeed even when no MetaMask is configured for the devnet — which
 * is always the case in CI Playwright runs and for first-time visitors to the
 * demo URL. Wallet signing and non-price-strip writes are not affected: wagmi
 * falls back to the HTTP transport only for read calls, never for signing.
 *
 * Test harnesses inject `window.ethereum` themselves before the page
 * loads — no test-only branches in this file.
