// Canonical: docs/architecture.md §5.3 — Human Dapp (runtime configuration)

/**
 * Runtime configuration fetch (issue #1356, mirrored from robotmoney/devops#5).
 *
 * ## Why this module exists
 *
 * Vite inlines every `import.meta.env.VITE_*` read into the bundle at build
 * time. Because the dapp image is commit-hash-addressed, per-environment
 * images are not viable — so a bundle built once could only ever point at
 * one set of contract addresses. This module moves the *deployment-shaped*
 * values (contract addresses, env class, RPC/explorer endpoints) into a
 * `/config.json` document fetched at startup, so one image serves every
 * environment.
 *
 * Authoring/serving `/config.json` is the stack tooling's job and is
 * deliberately out of scope here — this module only defines how the client
 * reads it.
 *
 * ## Layering
 *
 * The build-time env map remains the *base* layer; the fetched document is
 * an overlay on top of it. That keeps `bun run dev`, `vite preview`, and the
 * existing smoke-test images working unchanged when no `/config.json` is
 * served. "Not served" is detected by content type rather than by status:
 * `vite preview` answers a missing path with the SPA fallback (index.html,
 * HTTP 200), so a non-JSON response — not just a 404 — means "absent" and
 * falls back to the build-time values.
 *
 * ## Security — why the overlay is a strict allowlist
 *
 * `/config.json` is world-readable by anyone who can load the dapp, it is
 * separately mutable from the bundle, and it is attacker-visible in a way a
 * compiled bundle constant is not. Only the keys in `RUNTIME_CONFIG_KEYS`
 * are ever taken from it. Three exclusions are load-bearing rather than
 * incidental:
 *
 *   - `VITE_FAUCET_HARNESS_PRIVATE_KEY` stays build-time-only. Serving a
 *     private key from a fetched document would publish it to every
 *     requester of that URL; `buildEnvValidation.ts` already refuses to bake
 *     it into a mainnet-class bundle, and that guard would be meaningless if
 *     a runtime document could reintroduce the key.
 *   - `VITE_HISTORY_PANE` stays build+ADR-only. `featureFlags.ts` documents
 *     that flipping it must require a rebuild and an ADR, so no runtime
 *     toggle path is offered.
 *   - `VITE_GATEWAY_EXPECTED_CODE_HASH` stays build-time-only (issue #1375).
 *     It briefly rode along with the deployment-shaped keys when #1356
 *     introduced this module, which was a mistake: it is not deployment
 *     plumbing but a *verification pin*. `gatewayVerifier.ts` refuses every
 *     admin write unless `keccak256(getBytecode(gateway))` equals it, so it
 *     is the value that decides whether the other, runtime-supplied values
 *     may be written to at all. Two reasons it must live in the bundle:
 *
 *       1. A pin is worth exactly what the artifact carrying it is worth.
 *          `docs/architecture.md` §10 makes release provenance a
 *          prerequisite for public mainnet use; the moment the bundle is
 *          attested, a pin fetched from `/config.json` would be the one
 *          value the attestation did not cover — an attested bundle taking
 *          its trust anchor from an unattested document served by the same
 *          origin. (Today the dapp image carries no attestation, so nothing
 *          is weakened at present; this keeps the pin inside the artifact
 *          before provenance makes the gap real.)
 *       2. It could not be an environment-agnostic value anyway. The
 *          gateway's `usdcToken`, `vaultContract`, and `routerContract` are
 *          `immutable`, so they are baked into its *runtime* code and the
 *          hash differs per deployment. A one-image-many-environments build
 *          has no correct hash to pin — which is the honest consequence of
 *          this decision: a bundle that is to enable admin writes must be
 *          built for its deployment. One built without a pin fails closed
 *          (`computeVerificationState` refuses on an empty hash) rather than
 *          accepting one from a runtime document.
 *
 * Keys outside the allowlist are dropped with a warning rather than merged,
 * so a mistaken or hostile `/config.json` cannot reach either surface.
 */

/**
 * Deployment configuration as an env-shaped record. Env shape (rather than a
 * bespoke interface) is deliberate: `resolveFlags`, `resolveExplorerApiUrl`,

 * into every existing consumer.

 * security note in the module doc before adding to this list.
