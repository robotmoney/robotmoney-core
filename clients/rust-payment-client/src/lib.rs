//! Canonical: Plan tracking issue #109 §4 — Phase 1 Rust client (library surface for integration tests)
//!
//! `rust-payment-client` library crate.
//!
//! Re-exports the modules used by the `rmpc` binary so integration tests
//! (and, later, embedders) can build against the same types. The binary
//! entry point lives in `src/main.rs`.
