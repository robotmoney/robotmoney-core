# DemoAgentRwaBatchDeployer
[Git Source](https://github.com/lucky-tensor/robotmoney-monorepo/blob/a9c23f29365b1a58869648c1ae96ac66c7ca191a/contracts/script/DeployDemoExtraVaults.s.sol)

Batch deployer #2 — the RWA/Thematic placeholder vault (PRD §11.4)
plus the `AgentTokenVault` (PRD §11.3). Performs two direct
sub-CREATEs inside a single broadcaster CREATE. Kept separate
from `ProtocolVaultBatchDeployer` so combined initcode stays under
EIP-3860's 49152-byte limit (geth enforces this on the smoke-test
devnet). All vaults constructed with admin = adminAddr. Demo-only.
