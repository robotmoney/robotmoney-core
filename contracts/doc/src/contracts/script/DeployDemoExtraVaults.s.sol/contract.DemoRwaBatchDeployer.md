# DemoRwaBatchDeployer
[Git Source](https://github.com/robotmoney/robotmoney-monorepo/blob/895f74f9a312639869e61e1d4ba3dfce78950c03/contracts/script/DeployDemoExtraVaults.s.sol)

Batch deployer #2a — the real `RwaVault` (PRD §11.4, deSPXA) alone.
Split from `DemoAgentBatchDeployer` to keep each batch deployer's
initcode under EIP-3860's 49152-byte limit (geth enforces this on
the smoke-test devnet). `RwaVault` initcode is ~25KB; combining it
with `AgentTokenVault` (~24KB) would push combined initcode to ~51KB,
which exceeds the geth limit. Demo-only.
