[Git Source](https://github.com/lucky-tensor/robotmoney-monorepo/blob/d6ea170b5db4fe1e5559433d38b4563ca140fbfc/contracts/script/DeployDemoExtraVaults.s.sol)

Batch deployer #1 — the canonical `ProtocolAssetVault` (PRD §11.2)
deployed inside a single broadcaster CREATE. Constructed with
admin = adminAddr (the script broadcaster) so subsequent
`addAsset` + registry calls remain on the broadcast key. Demo-only.
