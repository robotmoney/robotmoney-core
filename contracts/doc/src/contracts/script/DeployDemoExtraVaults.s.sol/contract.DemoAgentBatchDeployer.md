[Git Source](https://github.com/robotmoney/robotmoney-monorepo/blob/7d568c59b4026ccbeb96c8683b875a28e63a7d18/contracts/script/DeployDemoExtraVaults.s.sol)

Batch deployer #2b — the `AgentTokenVault` (PRD §11.3) alone.
Split from the former `DemoAgentRwaBatchDeployer` to keep each
batch deployer's initcode under EIP-3860's 49152-byte limit.
All vaults constructed with admin = adminAddr. Demo-only.
