# DemoAgentBatchDeployer
[Git Source](https://github.com/lucky-tensor/robotmoney-monorepo/blob/690ce3eb1d770c8624dfe2b7c8dc1fb69a34bcd3/contracts/script/DeployDemoExtraVaults.s.sol)

Batch deployer #2b — the `AgentTokenVault` (PRD §11.3) alone.
Split from the former `DemoAgentRwaBatchDeployer` to keep each
batch deployer's initcode under EIP-3860's 49152-byte limit.
All vaults constructed with admin = adminAddr. Demo-only.
