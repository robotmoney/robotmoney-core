[Git Source](https://github.com/robotmoney/robotmoney-monorepo/blob/fb9985be700340695a515ae6d42f97a508023e8d/contracts/script/DeployDemoExtraVaults.s.sol)

Batch deployer #2b — the `AgentTokenVault` (PRD §11.3) alone.
Split from the former `DemoAgentRwaBatchDeployer` to keep each
batch deployer's initcode under EIP-3860's 49152-byte limit.
All vaults constructed with admin = adminAddr. Demo-only.
