[Git Source](https://github.com/robotmoney/robotmoney-core/blob/3da70a180fe71635ce61a9d127b7f2d7f7b3cbf5/contracts/script/DeployDemoExtraVaults.s.sol)

One-shot batch deployer for the RWA vault devnet stubs (PRD §11.4).
Deploys the deSPXA stand-in token, its USDC pool stub, the demo
Chronicle oracle stub, and the ChronicleOracleAdapter in a single
CREATE. Used by `DemoRwaBatchDeployer` to satisfy the RwaVault
`addAsset` gate (cardinality + liquidity) on the demo devnet.
Demo-only; never deployed on mainnet.
