**Title:**
RobotMoneyVault

Multi-adapter ERC-4626 USDC vault on Base. Dynamic equal-weight target across active
adapters. On-chain trustless pricing. Atomic deposit-to-yield AND withdraw — both
single-transaction, standard ERC-4626. Exit fee applied on withdrawal.
Yearn V3-inspired security: 2 roles + hardcoded floors.
Deployed: 0x4f835c9f54bcf17daf9040f60cb72951ccbb49dd (Base mainnet)
Compiler: v0.8.24+commit.e11b9ed9, optimized 200 runs, EVM Cancun


## Constants
### ADMIN_ROLE
Role that can manage adapters, set parameters, and rebalance.


```solidity
bytes32 public constant ADMIN_ROLE = keccak256("ADMIN_ROLE")
```


### EMERGENCY_ROLE
Role that can pause and perform emergency withdrawals.
Asymmetric with unpause by design: a compromised emergency key can
only halt the vault (DoS), not restart it. Unpause is restricted to
`ADMIN_ROLE` so that resuming operations is deliberate and requires
the higher-trust role — mirroring the gateway's `PAUSER_ROLE` /
`ADMIN_ROLE` asymmetry documented in `AccessRoles.sol`.


```solidity
bytes32 public constant EMERGENCY_ROLE = keccak256("EMERGENCY_ROLE")
```


### KEEPER_ROLE
Role for automated keeper rebalancing (not granted at launch).


```solidity
bytes32 public constant KEEPER_ROLE = keccak256("KEEPER_ROLE")
```


### MAX_EXIT_FEE_BPS
Absolute ceiling on exit fee (100 bps = 1%).


```solidity
uint256 public constant MAX_EXIT_FEE_BPS = 100
```


### MAX_ADAPTERS
Maximum number of strategy adapters the vault can hold.


```solidity
uint256 public constant MAX_ADAPTERS = 20
```


### MAX_BPS
Basis-points denominator (10 000 = 100%). Narrowed to `uint16`
from the shared `BpsMath.BPS_DENOMINATOR` to preserve this
constant's existing public type and call-site arithmetic.


```solidity
uint16 public constant MAX_BPS = uint16(BpsMath.BPS_DENOMINATOR)
```


### MAX_REBALANCE_BPS_CEILING
Keeper can never move more than 50% of TVL in a single rebalance call.


```solidity
uint16 public constant MAX_REBALANCE_BPS_CEILING = 5000
```


### MIN_REBALANCE_INTERVAL_FLOOR
Minimum enforced interval between rebalance calls (1 hour).


```solidity
uint256 public constant MIN_REBALANCE_INTERVAL_FLOOR = 1 hours
```


## State Variables
### adapters
Ordered registry of all strategy adapters (active and inactive).


```solidity
AdapterInfo[] public adapters
```


### adapterAllowed
Exact adapter instances approved by vault governance to receive this vault's USDC.


```solidity
mapping(address adapter => bool allowed) public adapterAllowed
```


### adapterCodeHashAllowed
Runtime bytecode hashes approved by vault governance for adapter onboarding.


```solidity
mapping(bytes32 codeHash => bool allowed) public adapterCodeHashAllowed
```


### tvlCap
Maximum total assets under management; deposits revert above this.


```solidity
uint256 public tvlCap
```


### perDepositCap
Maximum USDC that a single deposit may contribute.


```solidity
uint256 public perDepositCap
```


### exitFeeBps
Exit fee in basis points charged on withdrawals.


```solidity
uint256 public exitFeeBps
```


### feeRecipient
Recipient of collected exit fees.


```solidity
address public feeRecipient
```


### quarantineAddress
Destination for permissionless foreign-token sweeps (INV-1/INV-2).
Defaults to `ForeignTokenQuarantine.QUARANTINE`; settable only via
the TimelockController (ADMIN_ROLE, INV-3). The timelock-settable
model (vs. a pure compile-time constant) allows governance to
redirect sweeps to an on-chain multisig that can empty the trash.


```solidity
address public quarantineAddress
```


### shutdown
Whether the vault has been permanently shut down. Irreversible.


```solidity
bool public shutdown
```


### retired
Whether the vault has been retired by the unified governance
`retire()` lifecycle action (DI-2; docs/architecture.md §4.7).
When true, direct deposits/mints are hard-stopped at the vault.
Distinct from the emergency `shutdown` flag so the two
enforcement paths never alias: `shutdown` is an EMERGENCY_ROLE
vault-only overlay that makes no lifecycle decision, whereas
`retired` is set only by the governance retire action flipping
the registry to `Retired` in the same call. Recovery is the
deliberate governance abort `VaultRegistry.setVaultStatus(vault,
Active)` reflected back via `unretire()`.


```solidity
bool public retired
```


### registry
Linked `VaultRegistry`. Set once by `ADMIN_ROLE` after both
contracts are deployed. The registry is the only address allowed
to drive the vault's `retire()` / `unretire()` deposit-halt legs,
so the unified governance retire action (registry status flip +
vault deposit halt) lands atomically in a single timelock call to
`VaultRegistry.retire(vault)` without granting the registry full
`ADMIN_ROLE` over the vault.


```solidity
address public registry
```


### depositsPaused
When true, new deposits and mints are blocked.


```solidity
bool public depositsPaused
```


### withdrawalsPaused
When true, withdrawals and redeems are blocked.


```solidity
bool public withdrawalsPaused
```


### maxRebalanceBpsPerCall
Maximum fraction of TVL a keeper may move in one rebalance call (bps).


```solidity
uint16 public maxRebalanceBpsPerCall
```


### minRebalanceInterval
Minimum time between consecutive rebalance calls (seconds).


```solidity
uint256 public minRebalanceInterval
```


### lastRebalanceAt
Timestamp of the most recent completed rebalance.


```solidity
uint256 public lastRebalanceAt
```


## Functions
### constructor


```solidity
constructor(
    IERC20 _asset,
    uint256 _tvlCap,
    uint256 _perDepositCap,
    uint256 _exitFeeBps,
    address _feeRecipient,
    address _admin,
    address _emergencyResponder
) ERC4626(_asset) ERC20("Robot Money USDC", "rmUSDC");
```

### decimals

Returns the decimal precision used by this vault's share token (6, matching USDC).

Share token precision is fixed at 6 so that external tools (wallets, explorers,
integrators) always see a consistent denomination regardless of the internal
virtual-share scale chosen for inflation protection.
Raw-share scale note (for integrators):
The ERC-4626 virtual-share offset is 18 (see `_decimalsOffset`).  OpenZeppelin's
`_convertToShares` formula is:
shares = assets × (totalSupply + 10^18) / (totalAssets + 1)
For a fresh vault this yields `1e6 USDC → 1e24 raw shares`.  Because `decimals()`
returns 6, a user interface rendering `balanceOf(user) / 1e6` would display
`1e18` rmUSDC for a 1 USDC seed deposit.  This is intentional: the inflated share
count is what makes donation-based price manipulation economically infeasible.
Once the vault accumulates real TVL the share price converges to 1 rmUSDC ≈ 1 USDC
(in 6-decimal terms) and the raw count no longer dominates the display.


```solidity
function decimals() public pure override(ERC4626) returns (uint8);
```

### _decimalsOffset

Returns the ERC-4626 virtual-share decimal offset used to resist first-depositor
share-price inflation attacks.

Returning 18 configures OpenZeppelin's ERC-4626 virtual shares to `10^18` and
virtual assets to `1`.  With this setting the economic cost of a donation-based
inflation attack scales as `10^18` — orders of magnitude beyond any realistic
attacker budget — while legitimate depositors receive economically fair shares at
all TVL levels.
Raw-share scale (fresh vault, decimals() == 6, _decimalsOffset() == 18):
previewDeposit(1e6)  → 1e24 raw shares  (= 1e18 rmUSDC in 6-decimal display)
previewMint(1e24)    → 1e6 USDC
previewRedeem(1e24)  → ~1e6 USDC (minus exit fee if any)
previewWithdraw(1e6) → ~1e24 raw shares
Integrators MUST NOT assume raw shares equal asset amounts.  Always use
`convertToShares` / `convertToAssets` for on-chain math, or read `decimals()` and
divide accordingly in off-chain display logic.
See: docs/technical/security-model.md — ERC-4626 Inflation Attack Mitigation


```solidity
function _decimalsOffset() internal pure override returns (uint8);
```

### totalAssets

Sum of USDC held directly in the vault (idle) plus all eligible-and-active
adapter balances.

Idle USDC can accumulate via direct transfers or when `_routeDeposit` cannot place
all assets (e.g. all adapter caps are exhausted). Including it here prevents NAV
understatement and the associated TVL-cap bypass / share-price dilution described
in docs/code-reviews/code-review-codex-20260508-1522.md — Finding 2.
ADP-2 (F-14): an adapter whose eligibility was revoked while still registered as
`active` (allowlist withdrawn or codehash de-listed) is EXCLUDED from NAV. A
revoked adapter is no longer trusted to price its holdings, so continuing to count
its self-reported balance would let a compromised/lying adapter inflate the share
price (and, on the withdrawal side, drain honest holders' idle USDC). Eligibility
is restorable via `setAdapterAllowed`, and the funds remain drainable by EMERGENCY
via `emergencyWithdrawAdapter`, so this is an exclusion-not-confiscation.


```solidity
function totalAssets() public view override returns (uint256);
```

### _isAdapterCounted

An adapter contributes to NAV / receives proportional withdrawals only when it is
both registered-active AND currently eligible (allowlisted + codehash-pinned +
identity-bound). Centralises the ADP-2 NAV-side check so `totalAssets` and
`_pullProportional` can never drift apart.


```solidity
function _isAdapterCounted(uint256 i) internal view returns (bool);
```

### _deposit


```solidity
function _deposit(address caller, address receiver, uint256 assets, uint256 shares)
    internal
    override
    nonReentrant;
```

### _routeDeposit


```solidity
function _routeDeposit(uint256 amount) internal;
```

### _allocateTo


```solidity
function _allocateTo(uint256 i, uint256 amount) internal;
```

### previewRedeem

Estimate net USDC returned when redeeming `shares` (after exit fee).


```solidity
function previewRedeem(uint256 shares) public view override returns (uint256);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`shares`|`uint256`|Number of rmUSDC shares to simulate redeeming.|


### previewWithdraw

Estimate shares required to receive exactly `assets` USDC net (after exit fee).


```solidity
function previewWithdraw(uint256 assets) public view override returns (uint256);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`assets`|`uint256`|Target net USDC to receive.|


### maxWithdraw

Maximum USDC a user can withdraw in a single call (net of exit fee).
Overrides the OZ default to satisfy ERC-4626: withdraw(maxWithdraw(owner)) MUST NOT revert.
Uses floor rounding on the gross→net conversion so that
`_netToGross(maxWithdraw(owner))` never exceeds `_convertToAssets(balanceOf(owner), Floor)`,
guaranteeing `previewWithdraw(maxWithdraw(owner)) <= balanceOf(owner)` even when `exitFeeBps > 0`.
Returns 0 while withdrawals are paused, mirroring the deposit-side views
(ERC-4626: withdraw(maxWithdraw(owner)) MUST NOT revert; audit 2026-06-09, L-1).


```solidity
function maxWithdraw(address owner) public view override returns (uint256);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`owner`|`address`|The address whose share balance determines the withdrawal cap.|


### maxRedeem

Maximum shares a user can redeem in a single call.
Returns 0 while withdrawals are paused so that `redeem(maxRedeem(owner))`
never reverts, per ERC-4626 (audit 2026-06-09, L-1).


```solidity
function maxRedeem(address owner) public view override returns (uint256);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`owner`|`address`|The address whose share balance determines the redemption cap.|


### maxDeposit

Maximum assets that can be deposited for `receiver` given current vault state.
Returns 0 when deposits are paused, the vault is shutdown, retired,
no adapters are active, or the TVL cap has been reached.


```solidity
function maxDeposit(address) public view override returns (uint256);
```

### maxMint

Maximum shares that can be minted for `receiver` given current vault state.


```solidity
function maxMint(address receiver) public view override returns (uint256);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`receiver`|`address`|The address that would receive the minted shares.|


### _grossToNet


```solidity
function _grossToNet(uint256 gross) internal view returns (uint256);
```

### _netToGross


```solidity
function _netToGross(uint256 net) internal view returns (uint256);
```

### _withdraw


```solidity
function _withdraw(
    address caller,
    address receiver,
    address owner,
    uint256 assets,
    uint256 shares
) internal override nonReentrant;
```

### _pullProportional

Source `assetsNeeded` USDC into the vault, returning the amount ACTUALLY realised
(idle USDC applied + USDC genuinely withdrawn from adapters). Under honest adapters
the return equals `assetsNeeded`; `_withdraw` asserts the realised figure covers the
full share-implied gross before paying the exit fee (FEE-2 / NC-11), so an adapter
that over-reports its balance can never have its shortfall funded from other holders'
idle USDC — an under-delivering adapter reverts (`InsufficientAdapterLiquidity`).
Only eligible-and-active adapters (`_isAdapterCounted`) are pulled from: a revoked
adapter is excluded from NAV (`totalAssets`), so it must likewise be excluded here —
otherwise the proportional denominator would not match NAV and a revoked adapter
could still receive/return withdrawal flow (ADP-2 / F-14).


```solidity
function _pullProportional(uint256 assetsNeeded) internal returns (uint256);
```

### addAdapter

Register a new strategy adapter. Restricted to `ADMIN_ROLE`.


```solidity
function addAdapter(address adapter_, uint16 capBps_) external onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`adapter_`|`address`|Address of the `IStrategyAdapter`-compatible contract.|
|`capBps_`|`uint16`| Maximum allocation cap in basis points (1–10 000).|


### setAdapterAllowed

Approve or revoke an exact adapter instance for this vault. Restricted to `ADMIN_ROLE`.

Revoking the allowlist does NOT affect adapters already registered and active in the
registry. To fully quarantine an adapter, callers must separately call
`emergencyWithdrawAdapter` (to drain assets) followed by `removeAdapter` or
`forceRemoveAdapter` (to deactivate the registry entry). Setting `allowed_ = false`
only blocks future deposit allocations and new `addAdapter` calls for this address.


```solidity
function setAdapterAllowed(address adapter_, bool allowed_) external onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`adapter_`|`address`|Adapter address whose eligibility should change.|
|`allowed_`|`bool`|True to allow onboarding/allocation, false to revoke future allocations.|


### setAdapterCodeHashAllowed

Approve or revoke an adapter runtime bytecode hash. Restricted to `ADMIN_ROLE`.


```solidity
function setAdapterCodeHashAllowed(bytes32 codeHash_, bool allowed_)
    external
    onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`codeHash_`|`bytes32`|Runtime bytecode hash whose eligibility should change.|
|`allowed_`|`bool`| True to allow onboarding/allocation, false to revoke future allocations.|


### removeAdapter

Deactivate an adapter. The adapter must hold zero assets. Restricted to `ADMIN_ROLE`.


```solidity
function removeAdapter(uint256 index) external onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`index`|`uint256`|Registry index of the adapter to remove.|


### setAdapterCap

Update the allocation cap for an existing adapter. Restricted to `ADMIN_ROLE`.


```solidity
function setAdapterCap(uint256 index, uint16 newCapBps) external onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`index`|`uint256`|    Registry index of the adapter.|
|`newCapBps`|`uint16`|New maximum allocation cap in basis points (1–10 000).|


### rebalance

Keeper-triggered equal-weight rebalance. Callable by `ADMIN_ROLE` or `KEEPER_ROLE`.
Pulls excess from over-weight adapters and re-routes into under-weight adapters.
Subject to `minRebalanceInterval` and `maxRebalanceBpsPerCall` throttles.


```solidity
function rebalance() external nonReentrant;
```

### adminRebalance

Admin-specified precision rebalance: sets each adapter to an explicit target balance.
Restricted to `ADMIN_ROLE`.


```solidity
function adminRebalance(uint256[] calldata targetBalances)
    external
    onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE)
    nonReentrant;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`targetBalances`|`uint256[]`|Target USDC balance for each adapter (must match `adapters.length`).|


### setMaxRebalanceBpsPerCall

Update the per-call rebalance cap. Restricted to `ADMIN_ROLE`.


```solidity
function setMaxRebalanceBpsPerCall(uint16 newBps) external onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`newBps`|`uint16`|New cap in basis points (1–5 000; must not exceed `MAX_REBALANCE_BPS_CEILING`).|


### setMinRebalanceInterval

Update the minimum interval between rebalance calls. Restricted to `ADMIN_ROLE`.


```solidity
function setMinRebalanceInterval(uint256 newInterval) external onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`newInterval`|`uint256`|New minimum interval in seconds (must be ≥ `MIN_REBALANCE_INTERVAL_FLOOR`).|


### pause

Pause all deposits and withdrawals. Restricted to `EMERGENCY_ROLE`.


```solidity
function pause() external onlyRole(EMERGENCY_ROLE);
```

### unpause

Resume deposits and withdrawals. Restricted to `ADMIN_ROLE`.
Intentionally asymmetric: pausing is fast and unilateral (`EMERGENCY_ROLE`);
unpausing is deliberate and requires the higher-trust admin role.


```solidity
function unpause() external onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE);
```

### emergencyWithdraw

Pause the vault and attempt to withdraw all assets from every active adapter.
Uses `try/catch` so a failed adapter does not block others. Restricted to `EMERGENCY_ROLE`.
After this call, deposits are blocked but withdrawals remain open so users can exit.


```solidity
function emergencyWithdraw() external onlyRole(EMERGENCY_ROLE) nonReentrant;
```

### emergencyWithdrawAdapter

Pause deposits and withdraw all assets from a single adapter. Restricted to `EMERGENCY_ROLE`.
Withdrawals remain open so users can redeem assets pulled into idle USDC.


```solidity
function emergencyWithdrawAdapter(uint256 index)
    external
    onlyRole(EMERGENCY_ROLE)
    nonReentrant;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`index`|`uint256`|Registry index of the adapter to drain.|


### forceRemoveAdapter

Force-remove an adapter without withdrawing its assets (last-resort action).
Assets in the adapter are treated as lost. Restricted to `EMERGENCY_ROLE`.


```solidity
function forceRemoveAdapter(uint256 index) external onlyRole(EMERGENCY_ROLE);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`index`|`uint256`|Registry index of the adapter to force-remove.|


### setRegistry

Set the linked `VaultRegistry` once. Restricted to `ADMIN_ROLE`
(TimelockController in production — INV-3). The registry is the
only address permitted to call `retire()` / `unretire()`; this
dedicated link keeps the registry's authority over the vault
narrow (deposit-halt only, not full admin) while letting the
unified governance retire action land atomically.


```solidity
function setRegistry(address newRegistry) external onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`newRegistry`|`address`|Address of the `VaultRegistry` (must not be zero).|


### retire

Retire the vault: hard-stop direct deposits/mints. Callable ONLY
by the linked registry, which sets registry status to `Retired`
in the same call (atomic unified governance retire, DI-2). Not an
emergency control: it makes the deliberate lifecycle decision the
registry status flip records. Idempotent — re-retiring a retired
vault is a no-op event. Withdrawals/redemptions stay open
(ERC-4626 `redeem` is never revoked; ADR-0009).


```solidity
function retire() external;
```

### unretire

Reactivate a retired vault and re-open direct deposits. Callable
ONLY by the linked registry, which flips registry status back to
`Active` in the same call (governance abort path, mirroring the
`Retired → Active` transition in docs/architecture.md §4.7).


```solidity
function unretire() external;
```

### shutdownVault

Shut down the vault: set `shutdown = true` and zero the TVL cap.
Restricted to `EMERGENCY_ROLE`. Recoverable only by `ADMIN_ROLE`
via `restoreVault`, mirroring the `pause`/`unpause` trust
asymmetry: a compromised emergency hot key can DoS deposits but
cannot permanently brick the vault — re-opening requires the
higher-trust admin role.


```solidity
function shutdownVault() external onlyRole(EMERGENCY_ROLE);
```

### restoreVault

Reverse a `shutdownVault` and re-open deposits. Restricted to
`ADMIN_ROLE`. Intentionally asymmetric: shutting down is fast and
unilateral (`EMERGENCY_ROLE`); restoring is deliberate and requires
the higher-trust admin role. Because `shutdownVault` zeroed the TVL
cap, the admin supplies a fresh cap so deposits resume under an
explicit limit rather than silently reusing a stale value.


```solidity
function restoreVault(uint256 newTvlCap) external onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`newTvlCap`|`uint256`|New maximum total assets in 6-decimal USDC units (must be > 0).|


### setTvlCap

Update the TVL cap. Restricted to `ADMIN_ROLE`.


```solidity
function setTvlCap(uint256 newCap) external onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`newCap`|`uint256`|New maximum total assets in 6-decimal USDC units.|


### setPerDepositCap

Update the per-deposit cap. Restricted to `ADMIN_ROLE`.


```solidity
function setPerDepositCap(uint256 newCap) external onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`newCap`|`uint256`|New maximum single-deposit amount in 6-decimal USDC units.|


### setExitFeeBps

Update the exit fee. Restricted to `ADMIN_ROLE`.


```solidity
function setExitFeeBps(uint256 newBps) external onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`newBps`|`uint256`|New exit fee in basis points (0–`MAX_EXIT_FEE_BPS`).|


### setFeeRecipient

Update the fee recipient address. Restricted to `ADMIN_ROLE`.


```solidity
function setFeeRecipient(address newRecipient) external onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`newRecipient`|`address`|New address to receive collected exit fees.|


### setQuarantineAddress

Update the quarantine address for foreign-token sweeps. Restricted
to `ADMIN_ROLE` (held by TimelockController in production — INV-3).


```solidity
function setQuarantineAddress(address newAddr) external onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`newAddr`|`address`|New quarantine address. Must not be address(0).|


### sweepForeignToken

Permissionlessly sweep a NON-protected foreign token held by the
vault to the governed quarantine address (custody invariants
INV-1/INV-2).
Anyone may call; the destination is the timelock-gated
`quarantineAddress` storage variable — never a caller-supplied
address (INV-1). This replaces the deleted arbitrary-recipient
`rescueTokens(token,to)` admin function. The vault asset (USDC,
already counted in `totalAssets` and redeemable) and the vault
share token cannot be swept; protocol-asset donations therefore
stay in NAV and accrue pro-rata to all holders (INV-2). Adapter
strategy tokens live on the adapters, each of which exposes its
own guarded `sweepForeignToken`.


```solidity
function sweepForeignToken(address token) external nonReentrant;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`token`|`address`|Foreign ERC-20 to quarantine. Must not be the vault asset or the vault share token.|


### _setDepositsPaused

Set `depositsPaused` and emit an event if the state changes.


```solidity
function _setDepositsPaused(bool paused_) internal;
```

### _setWithdrawalsPaused

Set `withdrawalsPaused` and emit an event if the state changes.


```solidity
function _setWithdrawalsPaused(bool paused_) internal;
```

### _isAdapterEligible

Non-reverting twin of `_requireAdapterEligible`, used by `_routeDeposit`
to skip (rather than revert on) adapters whose eligibility was revoked
while still active in the registry (audit 2026-06-09, L-4).


```solidity
function _isAdapterEligible(address adapter_) internal view returns (bool);
```

### _requireAdapterEligible


```solidity
function _requireAdapterEligible(address adapter_) internal view;
```

### _requireAdapterCompatible


```solidity
function _requireAdapterCompatible(address adapter_) internal view;
```

### _targetBpsFor


```solidity
function _targetBpsFor() internal view returns (uint256);
```

### _activeAdapterCount


```solidity
function _activeAdapterCount() internal view returns (uint256);
```

### paused

Returns true when both deposits and withdrawals are blocked (full pause).
Provided for compatibility with tooling that queries `paused()`.


```solidity
function paused() external view returns (bool);
```

### adapterCount

Total number of adapters in the registry (active and inactive).


```solidity
function adapterCount() external view returns (uint256);
```

### isShutdown

Whether the vault has been permanently shut down.


```solidity
function isShutdown() external view returns (bool);
```

### getAdapterInfo

Detailed information about a single adapter entry.


```solidity
function getAdapterInfo(uint256 index)
    external
    view
    returns (
        address adapterAddr,
        uint16 capBps,
        bool active,
        uint256 currentBalance,
        uint256 targetBps
    );
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`index`|`uint256`|        Registry index of the adapter.|

**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`adapterAddr`|`address`| Address of the adapter contract.|
|`capBps`|`uint16`|      Maximum allocation cap in basis points.|
|`active`|`bool`|      Whether the adapter is currently active.|
|`currentBalance`|`uint256`|Live USDC value held by the adapter.|
|`targetBps`|`uint256`|   Current equal-weight target in basis points.|


### getAdapterDrift

Compute current vs. target balances and signed drift for every adapter.


```solidity
function getAdapterDrift()
    external
    view
    returns (
        uint256[] memory currentBalances,
        uint256[] memory targetBalances,
        int256[] memory drifts
    );
```
**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
