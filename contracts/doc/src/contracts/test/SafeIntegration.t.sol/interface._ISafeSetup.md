# _ISafeSetup
[Git Source](https://github.com/lucky-tensor/robotmoney-monorepo/blob/a9c23f29365b1a58869648c1ae96ac66c7ca191a/contracts/test/SafeIntegration.t.sol)

Used only to generate the `setup(...)` calldata for SafeProxyFactory.
Not imported from a Safe library to keep the test self-contained.
