# _ISafeSetup
[Git Source](https://github.com/lucky-tensor/robotmoney-monorepo/blob/eddfc6a75fd5558f18f4c48ae13aa1c3278c17e6/contracts/test/SafeIntegration.t.sol)

Used only to generate the `setup(...)` calldata for SafeProxyFactory.
Not imported from a Safe library to keep the test self-contained.
