# _ISafeSetup
[Git Source](https://github.com/lucky-tensor/robotmoney-monorepo/blob/cf8a75c9169f98b8e30f0ad4e13af73b36f22bc7/contracts/test/SafeIntegration.t.sol)

Used only to generate the `setup(...)` calldata for SafeProxyFactory.
Not imported from a Safe library to keep the test self-contained.
