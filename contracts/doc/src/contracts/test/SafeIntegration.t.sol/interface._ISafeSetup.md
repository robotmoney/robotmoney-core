# _ISafeSetup
[Git Source](https://github.com/lucky-tensor/robotmoney-monorepo/blob/4b538399027636f20b316ae10f72d0d6c6960fb1/contracts/test/SafeIntegration.t.sol)

Used only to generate the `setup(...)` calldata for SafeProxyFactory.
Not imported from a Safe library to keep the test self-contained.
