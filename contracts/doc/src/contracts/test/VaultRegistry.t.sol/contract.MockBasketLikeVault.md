# MockBasketLikeVault
[Git Source](https://github.com/robotmoney/robotmoney-monorepo/blob/5a164c31574dc88f5c31048af5cc49fb7a941a1f/contracts/test/VaultRegistry.t.sol)

Simulates the registry-gated retire pattern implemented by BasketVault
(FS-VLT-19): retire()/unretire() are only callable by the linked
registry, and they set/clear a `depositsPaused` flag. Used to assert
that VaultRegistry.retire(basketVaultAddress) completes without revert
when the vault has called setRegistry with the registry's address.
