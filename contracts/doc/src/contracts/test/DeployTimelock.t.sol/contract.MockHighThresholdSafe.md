# MockHighThresholdSafe
[Git Source](https://github.com/lucky-tensor/robotmoney-monorepo/blob/39467bf9ff113c7821b3343e7468c20f3d3ee5af/contracts/test/DeployTimelock.t.sol)

Minimal stub that mimics a compliant 2-of-3 Safe — `getThreshold()` returns 2.
Used as the SAFE_ADDRESS in setUp() so DeployTimelock's code-length and
threshold guards (issue #422) are satisfied without deploying a real Safe.


## Functions

```solidity
