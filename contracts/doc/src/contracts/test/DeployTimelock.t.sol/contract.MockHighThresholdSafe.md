# MockHighThresholdSafe
[Git Source](https://github.com/robotmoney/robotmoney-core/blob/93e714f46f12a94cb2f63f7a8dab827ff15fac4f/contracts/test/DeployTimelock.t.sol)

Minimal stub that mimics a compliant 2-of-3 Safe — `getThreshold()` returns 2.
Used as the SAFE_ADDRESS in setUp() so DeployTimelock's code-length and
threshold guards (issue #422) are satisfied without deploying a real Safe.


## Functions
### getThreshold


```solidity
