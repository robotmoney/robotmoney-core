# Report — and optionally gate on — the age of the committed Base fork pin.
#
# Canonical: docs/technical/full-stack-devnet.md §"Fork-state fixture" →
#            "Pin age (issue #1386)", which documents this gate's thresholds,
#            why the age is measured from CURRENT.json's captured_at, and the
#            refresh recipe this script's failure message points at.
# Issue:     #1386.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# The devnet's chain clock is wall-clock `now`
# (testing/ethereum-testnet/config/genesis/generate.sh, and
# smoke-test's `ensure_genesis_timestamp`), while the Aave V3 / Compound V3 /
# Morpho state the three adapters call is frozen at the pinned Base block
# captured in testing/fixtures/fork-state/CURRENT.json. Those protocols accrue
# interest as a function of `block.timestamp - lastUpdateTimestamp`, so the
# simulated interval between the snapshot and the devnet's "now" grows by one
# day per day. The pin used to be refreshed every 1-4 weeks; in 2026 it went
# 48 days without a refresh and nothing in CI said so. Silence is the defect
# this script fixes: the age is now printed on every run that validates the
# manifest, annotated as a GitHub `::warning::` past a soft threshold, and can
# be hard-gated with `--max-age-days` where failing is affordable (nightly).
#
# It deliberately does NOT hard-fail by default. A stale pin is a maintenance
# signal, not a reason to red every pull request in the queue — that is exactly
# the kind of unactionable blocking failure the CI-truthfulness work exists to
# remove. Pass `--max-age-days` from a scheduled job to get the hard signal.
#
# HOW TO REFRESH THE PIN when this reports a stale fixture:
#   RMPC_FORK_RPC_URL=<Base archive RPC> scripts/devnet/snapshot-fork.sh
# then update testing/ethereum-testnet/config/fork-block.json's `block_number`
# and `block_hash` to match the new CURRENT.json, and regenerate
# testing/fixtures/fork-state/genesis-alloc.json with
# `smoke-test-genesis-ingester` and
# testing/ethereum-testnet/config/expected-prices.json.
#
# NOTE ON THE RPC: snapshot-fork.sh defaults to
# https://base-rpc.publicnode.com, which serves state for only ~128 blocks
# (~4 minutes on Base) and rejects anything older with "Archive requests
# require a personal token". A capture session runs far longer than that, so
# the default endpoint cannot complete a refresh. Set RMPC_FORK_RPC_URL to a
# Base archive endpoint (issue #1239).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/devnet/check-fork-pin-age.sh                     # report + warn
#   scripts/devnet/check-fork-pin-age.sh --warn-days 14
#   scripts/devnet/check-fork-pin-age.sh --max-age-days 30   # hard gate
#   scripts/devnet/check-fork-pin-age.sh --manifest <path>   # self-test hook
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — age determined (whether or not the soft warning fired).
#   2 — manifest missing, unreadable, or has no usable `captured_at`.
#   3 — `--max-age-days` was supplied and the pin exceeds it.
