//! Schema sanity: bring up Postgres in a container, apply migrations,

//! with `chain_id` and (where applicable) `block_number` columns.
//!
//! Also covers issue #315 acceptance criteria:
//!   - Migration 0003 creates router_weight_snapshots, governance_proposals,
//!     governance_votes tables and the account_positions view.
//!   - vault_address column is added to vault_snapshots and backfilled.
//!
//! Issue #1359 adds the two `migrate_only_mode_*` tests, which drive the
//! compiled `indexer` binary rather than the library: they are the coverage for
//! the CLI's migrate-only mode now that the normal boot path no longer migrates.
//!
//! Issue #1392 adds the two `boot_*` tests (the normal boot path must refuse a
//! schema whose applied version differs from the embedded one, and must start
//! normally when they agree) and the two `migration_atomicity_*` tests (every
//! embedded migration runs inside a transaction, plus the negative self-test
//! proving that guard is not vacuous).
//!
//! Issue #1383 removed the "skips cleanly when Docker is not available" escape:
//! `pg_fixture()` / `raw_pg()` are infallible and panic naming Docker/Postgres,
//! so a run without a container is RED here, never a green zero-assertion pass.

//
// `migrate_only_mode_exits_non_zero_on_a_broken_migration` observes that a

// atomicity that makes that true in general: sqlx wraps each migration in a
// transaction, and a migration can opt out with `-- no-transaction`. If one
// ever did, that test would stay green while the property was gone.
//
// The guard chosen is an assertion over the EMBEDDED `no_tx` flag rather than a
// grep of the `.sql` files for the literal `-- no-transaction`. The flag is what
// sqlx actually acts on, so the guard cannot disagree with the migrator: a
// marker that is mis-spelled, indented, or below the first line would pass a
// grep while still running inside a transaction, and a future sqlx spelling of
// the opt-out would defeat a grep entirely.
//
// KNOWN LIMIT (issue #1416, filed from this work): on stable Rust `sqlx::migrate!`
// registers no rerun-if-changed dependency on `migrations/`, and this crate has no
// build.rs, so a change that touches ONLY a `.sql` file may not recompile the crate
// against a warm target dir — the guard would then read a stale embedded set. That
// is a build-freshness defect, not a hole in the guard, and it is tracked separately
