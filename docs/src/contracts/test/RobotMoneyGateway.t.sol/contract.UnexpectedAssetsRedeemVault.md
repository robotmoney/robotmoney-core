# UnexpectedAssetsRedeemVault
[Git Source](https://github.com/lucky-tensor/robotmoney-monorepo/blob/31a8dcee8651b68de6fb5481acf7c895437acde1/contracts/test/RobotMoneyGateway.t.sol)

**Inherits:**
[MockVault](/contracts/gateway/MockVault.sol/contract.MockVault.md)

Vault that, during redeem, routes USDC to the caller (the gateway)
instead of to the designated receiver. This trips the post-redeem
gateway-USDC-balance invariant (UnexpectedAssetsReceived).

```

### redeem
