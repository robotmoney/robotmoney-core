# IPrototypeAware
[Git Source](https://github.com/lucky-tensor/robotmoney-monorepo/blob/75c9d821b281975c99c1bcf5090a766acfe071b0/contracts/PortfolioRouter.sol)

Minimal introspection interface used to detect vaults that
self-declare prototype status via `isPrototype()`. Implemented by
`contracts/vaults/BasketVault.sol` and inherited by every
`BasketVault` subclass. Defined here as a local interface so
`PortfolioRouter` has no compile-time dependency on the prototype
vaults themselves — any contract that exposes `isPrototype()
returns (bool)` participates in the production-readiness gate.
