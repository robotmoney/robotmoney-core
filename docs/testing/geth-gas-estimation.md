# Geth Gas Estimation: Why the Devnet Harness Must Buffer Gas

This document records a class of **silent out-of-gas failures** that the Geth
smoke-test devnet produces, why they look like contract bugs but are not, and
the buffering policy the test harness applies to match production wallet
behaviour.

---

## Symptom

The `simulated_depositors_fund_all_four_vaults` test in
`testing/smoke-test/tests/demo_seeding.rs` panicked intermittently with:

```
depositor 0x1f66…6296 holds no primary-vault shares
```

The same test passed on most runs. The job
`smoke-test-devnet-cli_meta` was flaky on `dev` itself (failure / failure /
success), so it was not introduced by any single PR.

## Root cause

The seeding flow funds each depositor and then, **concurrently across
depositors**, signs a router deposit plus four direct vault deposits. Because
the depositors run on independent threads with independent nonces, the chain
mines several of their deposits **into the same block**.

Tracing the failing run (devnet block `0x3f`, three primary-vault deposits):

| order in block | depositor | gasUsed | status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| index 0 | `0xBc22…` | 1,125,400 | success |
| index 1 | `0x44D2…` | 1,222,209 | success |
| index 2 | `0x1f66…` | 1,292,424 | **revert (out-of-gas)** |

Three identical `deposit(uint256,address)` calls into the **same** primary
`RobotMoneyVault`, yet gas usage **rises with position in the block** and only
the last one reverts — having consumed essentially its entire gas cap.

Two compounding effects produce this:

1. **Same-block state growth.** The primary vault is not a passthrough; it
   routes USDC into a real strategy adapter (`AaveV3Adapter` /
   `CompoundV3Adapter` / `MorphoAdapter`). `RobotMoneyVault._routeDeposit`
   computes allocation targets from `totalAssets()`, and the adapter's `deploy`
   touches storage whose cost depends on prior in-block deposits. A deposit that
   executes *after* two earlier same-block deposits genuinely costs more gas
   than one executing first.

2. **Estimation against pre-block state.** `eth_estimateGas` runs against the
   latest *mined* block, where **none** of the three pending deposits has
   applied. All three therefore receive roughly the same estimate — the cost of
   being *first*. When `cast send` forwards that bare estimate as the gas limit,
   the deposit that ends up last in the block needs more gas than it was given
   and reverts out-of-gas.

This is the same family of failure documented in issue #897, where Geth
under-estimated an ERC-4626 `redeem` because storage-clearing gas refunds are
not reflected in `eth_estimateGas`. The mechanism differs (refunds there,
in-block growth here) but the fix is identical: **do not trust the bare
estimate**.

### Why it was silent

`cast send` exits `0` as soon as the transaction is *mined*, regardless of its
execution `status`. An out-of-gas revert produces a receipt with
`status: "0x0"` and a transaction hash — which the old `cast_send` returned as
`Ok(tx_hash)`. The seeding loop saw "success" for a deposit that minted zero
shares, and the failure only surfaced later as the misleading
"holds no primary-vault shares" assertion.

## Why this is not a contract bug

In production, deposits are submitted by real wallets (MetaMask and friends),
which **always pad** the node's gas estimate before signing — typically by
~1.5x. Under those wallets the same concurrent deposits succeed: the padding
absorbs the in-block growth. The contract behaviour is correct; the only thing
diverging from production was the test harness sending **unbuffered** gas
limits. Serialising the deposits to dodge the collision would have *hidden*
real production concurrency, not reproduced it — so the harness was changed to
behave like the wallets it stands in for.

## The fix

`Fixture::cast_send` now mirrors a production wallet:

1. **Estimate, then buffer.** `estimate_gas_buffered` calls `cast estimate`
   (from the real sender address) and scales the result by **1.5x** — the same
   buffer the dapp-e2e mock wallet adopted in #897. The send forwards this as an
   explicit `--gas-limit`.
2. **Fail loudly on revert.** After the send, the receipt's `status` is checked;
   anything other than `0x1` (including out-of-gas) returns an `Err` instead of
   an `Ok(tx_hash)`. A failed deposit can no longer masquerade as a successful
   one.
3. **Reject doomed transactions early.** A failing `cast estimate` means the
   transaction would revert on-chain; that surfaces as an `Err` before anything
   is signed.

The 1.5x buffer is generous relative to the observed in-block growth (the
reverting deposit needed only ~6% more gas than the first), and on the devnet —
where the gas price is a few hundred thousand wei — the larger gas *limit* costs
nothing meaningful against each depositor's 0.05 ETH float.

## Guidance for harness authors

- Any helper that signs a devnet transaction whose cost is **state-dependent**
  (vault deposits/withdrawals, adapter rebalances, router splits) must buffer
  gas. Use `Fixture::cast_send`; do not call `cast send` without a buffered
  `--gas-limit`.
- Never treat a `cast send` exit code as proof of execution success — always
  assert `status == 0x1`.
- If a devnet test is flaky only under concurrency, suspect gas estimation
  before suspecting the contract. Serialising to "fix" it trades a real
  production signal for a green check.
