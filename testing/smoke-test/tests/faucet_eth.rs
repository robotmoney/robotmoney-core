//! Smoke-test for the native Base ETH faucet drip round-trip (issue #466).
//!
//! Verifies:
//!   1. The harness EOA holds non-zero native ETH at devnet boot (the
//!      precondition for any ETH drip preflight in the dapp).
//!   2. `Fixture::fund_eth_from_harness` performs a real signed value
//!      transfer and the recipient's native balance increases by the
//!      exact amount — same code path the dapp's `dripEth` exercises.
//!   3. Concurrent drips from the one faucet key all land, none rejected
//!      with `replacement transaction underpriced` (issue #1374).
//!   4. A drip the faucet cannot afford still fails loudly, with a message
//!      that cannot be confused with that nonce race (issue #1374).
//!
//! Run with:
//!   cargo test -p smoke-test -- faucet_eth --test-threads=1 --nocapture
//!
//! Canonical: docs/architecture.md §5.3 — Human Dapp (faucet UX)
